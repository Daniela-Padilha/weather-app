# 🌦️ Weather App

This is a simple weather app built as a learning project.

It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a clean interface.

The goal of this project was to practice core web development skills and learn how JavaScript interacts with online data.

# 🎯 What I Learned in This Project
1. ✅ Asynchronous programming

  - Using fetch() to get data from an external API

  - Working with Promises

  - Using async/await to handle asynchronous operations smoothly

2. ✅ API usage

    - Sending a request to the OpenWeatherMap API

    - Extracting useful information (temperature, weather description, etc.)

3. ✅ CSS Flexbox

    - Arranging content on the page using flexbox

    - Centering elements and creating a responsive layout

4. ✅ DOM manipulation

    - Updating the page dynamically using ``` document.getElementById() ```

    - Inserting API data directly into the HTML elements

    - Handling user input (like city search)

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML

- CSS (Flexbox)

- JavaScript

- OpenWeatherMap API

# 🚀 How It Works

1. User types a city name.

2. JavaScript sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.

3. The app receives JSON data about the weather.

4. The UI updates using DOM manipulation.

# ⚠️ Note About API Key

This project uses the OpenWeatherMap Free API, which is safe to expose in browser-based learning projects.

# 📚 Purpose of This Project

This is not a production app.
It was created to practice:

- Asynchronous JavaScript

- Working with APIs

- DOM manipulation

- Basic UI layout with Flexbox
